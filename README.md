**DISMANTLE** is a fast-paced first-person horror shooter set in dark, industrial corridors filled with enemies that want you dead. Armed with multiple weapons, limited ammo, and your survival instincts — fight through waves of ground troops, flying threats, turrets, and a terrifying multi-phase boss.

The game blends **classic retro FPS gameplay** with **modern horror atmosphere** — dynamic post-processing, blood flash effects, camera shake on every hit, and an adaptive boss music system that kicks in the moment danger arrives.
